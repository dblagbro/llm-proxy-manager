# Changelog

All notable changes since v2.7.6. Older history available in `git log`.

The project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) loosely:
**major** = breaking API changes; **minor** = additive features; **patch** = fixes.

## v3.0.x — Run runtime, cluster ops, observability

### v3.0.20 — ApiKey tombstone-aware delete (resurrection bug)

Same shape as v2.8.2's Provider tombstone fix. Previously, hard-DELETE'ing an API key on one node was reversed by the next cluster sync push from a peer that still had the row — `apply_sync` saw `existing is None` and re-INSERTed it. Test/regression keys couldn't be cleaned up; admin-deleted keys reappeared within ~60s.

Now `ApiKey` has a `deleted_at` column. The DELETE handler soft-deletes (`deleted_at = now`, `enabled = False`). Sync push includes tombstoned rows; `apply_sync` propagates peer tombstones locally and preserves local tombstones against non-tombstoned peer rows. Lookups filter `deleted_at IS NULL` (the auth path already filtered `enabled=True` so unauthorized requests were already blocked, but the admin list now hides them too). Tombstones older than `provider_tombstone_retention_days` (default 7) are hard-deleted by the daily prune sweep.

### v3.0.19 — fix codex-oauth keep-alive probe path

Same shape as v2.7.2's claude-oauth probe fix that I forgot to extend when v3.0.16 landed: the keep-alive probe was sending codex-oauth providers through `litellm.acompletion(model="openai/gpt-5.5")`, which routes to `api.openai.com` — that endpoint rejects Codex CLI bearer tokens with `"Missing scopes: model.request"`. Every 5-min probe cycle was failing → CB tripped after 3 failures → real traffic hit CB-open during the hold-down windows. Now uses the same direct dispatch path as real traffic (`chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses` with the right headers + Responses API body shape), draining a streaming POST until `response.completed`.

### v3.0.18 — OAuth refresh-token race recovery

When two cluster nodes independently refresh the same OAuth provider's access_token within the 60s sync window, Anthropic and OpenAI both rotate the refresh_token on every call — whichever node loses the race gets back `invalid_grant` and would previously trip the 24h auth-failure CB until an admin manually re-pasted credentials. Now the loser fans out a signed `GET /cluster/oauth-pull/{provider_id}` to each peer; whichever peer has the freshest non-expired tokens responds, the loser adopts them locally, and the original chat call retries seamlessly. Only raises (back to the existing CB path) if no peer has fresher tokens — i.e. real upstream revocation.

Applies to both `claude-oauth` and `codex-oauth` provider types. Same HMAC-of-(node_id) auth as `/cluster/settings` for the new endpoint. +7 unit tests for the recovery paths (cluster-disabled / no-peers / picks-freshest / skips-expired / skips-unreachable).

### v3.0.17 — chain-bump priority on OAuth /exchange paths

`POST /api/providers/claude-oauth/exchange` and `POST /api/providers/codex-oauth/exchange` now call `_bump_priority_conflicts(...)` before inserting the new row, matching the standard `POST /api/providers` behavior. Without this, adding an OAuth provider at a priority already in use produced a momentary tie until the next cluster sync's `normalize_priority_ties` resolved it (60s window). Tie no longer occurs at insert time.

### v3.0.16 — codex-oauth provider + path-relative frontend

- **`codex-oauth` provider type** — OpenAI Codex CLI / ChatGPT subscription OAuth, billed to Plus/Pro/Team/Enterprise quota instead of API tokens. Mirrors the claude-oauth admin UX (Generate Auth URL → browser approval → paste callback). Full pipeline: PKCE flow → token exchange → refresh-token rotation → Chat Completions ↔ Responses API translator → request dispatch via `chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`.
- **Path-relative frontend** — `base: './'` in `vite.config.ts` plus runtime `getBasePath()` detection so a single built bundle deploys at any URL prefix. Smoke node now actually serves the SPA correctly at `/llm-proxy2-smoke/` (was previously broken — only `/health` worked).
- **Rate-limit awareness for codex-oauth** — reads `x-codex-*` headers on every successful response (plan tier, used %, reset-at, window minutes); force-opens the CB on 429 / limit-exceeded with hold-down equal to upstream's reset-after seconds. New `/api/providers/{id}/rate-limit` admin endpoint surfaces state for monitoring.
- **`scan_models` endpoint fix** — comprehension expected `list[str]` from `scan_provider_models` but it returns `list[dict]`. Latent for all provider types since v3.0.9; surfaced when codex-oauth scan returned 6 real models. `unhashable type: 'dict'` fixed.
- **OAuth edit-rotate clobber fix** — extends the v2.7.x `api_key` preservation to also cover `extra_config` (preserves the rotate endpoint's freshly-stashed `chatgpt_account_id`/`chatgpt_plan_type` against the form snapshot's PUT). Applies to both claude-oauth and codex-oauth.
- **Tests** — +10 translator + +10 ratelimit; 822 unit tests green.

### v3.0.14 — runtime model-deprecation auto-bump

When upstream returns a `NotFoundError` for a model in our `MODEL_DEPRECATIONS` registry, `acompletion_with_retry` now persists the replacement to every active provider's `default_model` and retries the same call once with the new model id. Closes the boot-time-only gap from v3.0.9 — if a vendor retires a model live mid-day, we self-heal on the first failure instead of bleeding errors until the next deploy. The bump is one retry per call (no infinite loop); if the replacement also fails, the existing CB / next-provider fallback path takes over.

### v3.0.13 — tombstone garbage collection + rolling-deploy caveat

- **Tombstone GC** — daily prune sweep now hard-deletes `Provider` rows whose `deleted_at` is older than `provider_tombstone_retention_days` (default 7, env `PROVIDER_TOMBSTONE_RETENTION_DAYS`). Closes the long-standing TODO from v2.8.2's soft-delete design. Cluster sync converges in seconds, so 7 days is a comfortable safety margin before hard-delete.
- **README** — adds the v3.0.11 mixed-version rolling-deploy caveat to the deploy section so future operators don't lose an edit during the brief upgrade window.

### v3.0.12 — provider name dedup + drop v3.0.9 backstop instrumentation

- **Boot-time dedup:** `dedup_providers_by_name` collapses duplicate-name active provider rows (cluster-sync legacy) into one survivor — keeps the highest-priority row (lowest `priority` value; ties broken by oldest `created_at`, then lowest `id`), tombstones the rest. Idempotent. Tombstone stamps `last_user_edit_at` so the dedup decision propagates as an authoritative cluster-sync edit.
- **Create/update guard:** POST `/api/providers` and PUT `/api/providers/{id}` now 409 on duplicate names. The OAuth-flow `/api/providers/claude-oauth/exchange` shares the same guard.
- **Removed v3.0.9 backstops' `logger.info` lines** for `oauth.max_tokens_default_applied` and `oauth.cc_marker_omitted` — fleet-wide scan showed zero triggers; defaults stay in place but quietly.
- **Smoke node graduation:** `/llm-proxy2-smoke/` on www01 is now a permanent pre-prod stage.

### v3.0.11 — last_user_edit_at gates cluster-sync LWW

Provider rows now carry a separate `last_user_edit_at` Unix timestamp set only by admin-facing endpoints (create / update / delete / toggle / OAuth rotate / OAuth exchange). Cluster sync prefers it over `updated_at` when both sides have one, so a peer's OAuth auto-refresh, deprecation auto-bump, or priority tie-break can't make the row look fresher than a real rename or config edit. Local edits beat peer rows that have no stamp (conservative during mixed-version rollout windows).

### v3.0.10 — cluster sync covers name + daily_budget + OAuth fields; force-sync-now endpoint

Provider sync payload was missing the `name`, `daily_budget_usd`, `oauth_refresh_token`, and `oauth_expires_at` fields — renames and budget changes on one node never reached peers. Plus an admin-only `POST /cluster/sync-now` endpoint to force convergence after a config change without waiting for the 60s loop.

### v3.0.9 — deprecation auto-bump + stale-bundle banner + dead-code instrumentation

- **`app/providers/deprecations.py`** — `MODEL_DEPRECATIONS` registry (deprecated → replacement) with current Google / Anthropic / OpenAI retirements. `migrate_deprecated_default_models(db)` runs at boot (idempotent) and bumps every provider row's `default_model` to the registered replacement. `check_model_deprecation(model)` used by `/test` and `/scan-models` response builders to surface deprecation warnings in the UI before the upstream 404s on real traffic.
- **Stale-bundle banner** — `Layout.tsx` watches first-observed `/health` version and shows a "Reload now" banner when the served app diverges (browser cache after deploy).
- **Backstop instrumentation** added to `_messages_streaming.py` for the `max_tokens` default + cache_control marker cap-check (later removed in v3.0.12 after a week of zero triggers).
- **Smoke node roll-forward** to v3.0.9 alongside the production fleet.

### v3.0.8 — refactor: SCHEMA-type fix + auth dedup + worker split

Three pure refactors — no behavior change, 799 unit tests still green.

- **SCHEMA-type structural fix** — pydantic field annotations on `app.config.Settings` are now the canonical source of setting types; `config_runtime.SCHEMA`'s `type` is a UI hint and a fallback. `_pydantic_field_type` + `canonical_type` + `validate_schema_consistency` (boot-time WARN). Closes the v3.0.1 bug class where SCHEMA said `"str"` for a float field and `_coerce` returned a string into a numeric comparison.
- **Auth dedup** — new `get_api_key_record` + `resolve_api_key_dep` factory in `app/auth/keys.py`; `app/api/runs.py` collapsed 5 raw_key extraction blocks into `Depends(_AUTH)`.
- **Worker split** — `app/runs/worker.py::_drive()` (was 250 lines) split into per-state handlers (`_step_check_deadline`, `_step_queued`, `_step_running`, `_handle_tool_use`, `_handle_terminal_text`, `_peek_next_model`, `_maybe_compact_run`, `_wait_for_rate_limit_slot`, `_fail_run`).

### v3.0.7 — daily prune worker for activity_log + provider_metrics + run_events

Daily background sweep prunes rows older than `activity_log_retention_days` (default 30 days, admin-tunable). Batched DELETEs (5000 rows/batch) keep individual transactions short under WAL mode. Initial sweep delayed 1h post-boot.

### v3.0.6 — sortable metrics columns + per-provider 24h chips

- **MetricsPage:** all 6 columns (Provider / Requests / Success % / Avg Latency / Tokens / Cost) clickable to sort. Toggle direction by clicking the active column.
- **ProvidersPage:** 24h metrics chip inline on each provider card (`24h: N req · X% · Yms · N tok · $Z`); hidden when zero traffic. Sort-by selector at top: Priority, Name, Requests, Success rate, Latency, Cost.

### v3.0.5 — clean 503 on `/v1/messages` when all providers unavailable

Catches `RuntimeError("All providers are currently unavailable")` from `select_provider` and converts to a 503 with an actionable message naming the most-likely cause (Anthropic OAuth revocation → 24h breaker) and the fix (re-auth via UI). Same shape as the v3.0.4 fix on `/v1/chat/completions`. Triggered during cutover monitoring when GCP node's claude-oauth tokens were server-side revoked.

### v3.0.4 — clean 503 on `/v1/chat/completions` when no compatible providers

Catches `RuntimeError("No providers available after excluding types {'claude-oauth'}")` and converts to a 503 with a message naming the cause (claude-oauth providers can't dispatch through `/v1/chat/completions`) and the two valid resolutions (use `/v1/messages` OR enable a non-OAuth provider). Triggered during the v1-chain retirement window when only claude-oauth providers were enabled.

### v3.0.3 — SQLite WAL + busy_timeout fix

`PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL` (one-time, db-file-level) + `PRAGMA busy_timeout=10000` (per-connection via SQLAlchemy event listener) + `PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL` (safe with WAL). Fixes `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` under concurrent write load (cluster sync receivers + Run worker events + keep-alive probes + activity log all hitting the same file).

### v3.0.2 — keep-alive probes + pricing fix

- **Pricing:** previous `litellm.completion_cost(prompt_tokens=...)` API was rejected by current litellm with TypeError, silently falling through to $0.00 for everything. Switched to `litellm.cost_per_token`. Override table now matches bare model names (no provider prefix) so claude-oauth dispatched calls resolve correctly.
- **Keep-alive probes:** new `app/monitoring/keepalive.py` sweeps every enabled provider every 5 min (configurable; 0 disables). Per-provider unique prompt (`Hi from <ProviderName>`) so activity_log rows are distinguishable. Tagged `[probe]` + `probe: true` in metadata. Handles claude-oauth via the OAuth dispatch path.

### v3.0.1 — post-v3.0.0 regression fixes

- **Settings type drift** — four `SCHEMA` entries declared `type='str'` for fields the pydantic settings layer types as `float`. When a node inserted a SystemSetting row, `_coerce(value, value_type='str')` returned the raw string, and `settings.shadow_traffic_rate > 0` raised `TypeError: '>' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'` on every successful non-streaming `/v1/messages` call. Fixed: SCHEMA types corrected; `load()` now coerces using SCHEMA-declared type, not row-stored value_type (schema is authoritative).
- **`spending_cap_usd` sentinel** narrowed: `>= 0` (was `> 0`) so zero stays a hard block while `-1` clears.
- **`collect_sse` test helper** filters non-default-channel `data:` lines (was capturing `event: budget` heartbeat as a regular event).

### v3.0.0 — Run runtime (final)

Six-phase joint delivery with the coordinator-hub team. Server-mediated agent loop replacing black-box `claude --print` invocations.

- **R1** — Schema (`runs`, `run_messages`, `run_events`, `run_idempotency`) + pure FSM with 63 transition tests + stub endpoints + OpenAPI artifact + per-user UTC/timezone preferences
- **R2** — Worker (one `asyncio.Task` per Run) + hard per-call deadline (`asyncio.wait_for(connect=10s, read=60s)`) + `ConnectTimeout`/`ReadTimeout` → immediate fail-over (B.7 fix) + recovery sweep on startup with `run_recovered` events + 4 chaos tests
- **R3** — Context compaction at 80% threshold (cheapest haiku or `compaction_model` override) + tool spec translation (Anthropic↔OpenAI per provider's `native_tools` capability) + cancel-mid-tool-wait
- **R4** — In-memory event broker (1000-event ring per run, sub-100ms SSE) + `Last-Event-ID` resume + 15s keepalive + idempotency LRU cache
- **R5** — Cluster stickiness (307 redirect to owner node) + debounced state replication (250ms non-terminal, sync-acked terminal) + `POST /v1/runs/{id}/adopt` with 30s owner-grace
- **R6** — Per-Run rate limit (`runs_max_model_calls_per_minute=5` default) + 100-concurrent-runs load test + chaos suite + `docs/runs-runbook.md`

Joint smoke against v3.0.0-r4: 5/5 green.

## v2.9.x — UI polish + metrics page fix

### v2.9.1 — activity row inline req/resp previews
Each row now shows `→ <request preview>` + `← <response preview>` inline (240 chars each); error replaces response slot on failure. ~3 lines per row → 3 dense lines with inline meta.

### v2.9.0 — settings tooltips + metrics page fix
- `?` HelpHint icon next to every CoT-E / Native-Reasoning / Circuit-Breaker / Email-Alerts setting
- Metrics page un-broken: `get_all_provider_summary` had referenced `r.avg_ttft_ms` not in SELECT, 500'd silently, frontend rendered all zeros. Now aggregates ttft properly + shows provider names alongside IDs.

---

## v2.8.x — claude-oauth chain isolation, activity log payload capture

### v2.8.11 — exclude claude-oauth from `/v1/chat/completions`
OAuth providers were occasionally selected for OpenAI-format requests, surfacing as `Connection error.` upstream. Filter at routing.

### v2.8.10 — non-empty `error_str` + 300s OAuth non-stream timeout
`str(httpx.ReadTimeout())` was `""`, making activity_log show `error: null` for upstream timeouts. Added `_exc_str()` helper that falls back to exception class name. Bumped non-stream OAuth timeout from 60s → 300s for parity with streaming.

### v2.8.9 — three claude-oauth error patterns from activity log
Cache_control overflow (count existing markers, omit ours when total ≥ 4), default `max_tokens=4096`, internal-pipeline OAuth filter (`excluded_provider_types={"claude-oauth"}` on cascade cheap_route, CoT critique_route, hedging backup_route, grader_route).

### v2.8.8 — never run claude-oauth providers through litellm chain
Fallback chain skips OAuth providers; only the dedicated `_complete_claude_oauth` / `_stream_claude_oauth` handlers reach platform.claude.com.

### v2.8.7 — whitelist 1M-context flag
Older Sonnet/Opus snapshots 400'd on the 1M-context beta flag; now whitelisted per-model.

### v2.8.6 — two 502 root causes
`UnboundLocalError` on cache-miss path + OAuth chain falling into litellm dispatch. Fixed both.

### v2.8.5 — activity log: pagination, search, refresh, per-provider names
Cursor-based pagination via `before_id`, case-insensitive substring search across message + provider_id + JSON-stringified metadata. Per-provider names instead of bare IDs.

### v2.8.4 — activity log: full request/response payload capture
Embed serialized request + response bodies (up to 50KB each, scrubbed of secrets) into `event_meta` so the activity log captures the full call shape including tool calls.

### v2.8.3 — cluster sync respects `updated_at` for active providers
Race fix: cluster-sync was occasionally resurrecting soft-deleted providers.

### v2.8.2 — priority auto-bump + soft-delete + sync convergence
Insert/update with conflicting priority chains a deterministic auto-bump. Tombstone-aware soft-delete via `deleted_at` column.

### v2.8.1 — UI cleanup pass
Remove OAuth Capture page (legacy), refresh Routing docs.

### v2.8.0 — model-slug shortcuts + auto-routing + re-auth UI
OpenRouter-parity `:floor` / `:nitro` / `:exacto` suffixes; `model: "auto"` lets LMRH pick provider AND model; in-form re-auth flow for claude-oauth providers.

---

## v2.7.x — Claude Pro Max OAuth provider, hardening

### v2.7.8 — Tier 2 hardening sweep
Activity log indexes (`ix_activity_log_*`), API keys hot-lookup index, claude-oauth auth-failure 24h breaker, BUG-005 / BUG-010 / BUG-017 fixes.

### v2.7.7 — in-place claude-oauth re-auth from the edit form
Rotate tokens via `/oauth-rotate` endpoint while editing; no need to re-create the provider.

### v2.7.6 — Tier 1 + quick-wins remediation sweep
*(Last touch on README before v3.0.7's refresh.)*

### v2.7.5 — comprehensive live-test coverage + production fixes
End-to-end script (`scripts/test_claude_oauth_live.py`) exercising tool_use, streaming, vision, prompt caching against real Claude Pro Max accounts.

### v2.7.4 — scan-models support
List models via `platform.claude.com/v1/models`.

### v2.7.3 — Claude Code system marker + native test path
Anthropic returns masked `rate_limit_error` without the marker; mandatory.

### v2.7.2 — real Claude Code OAuth endpoint + CODE#STATE paste
Pulled real endpoints from the claude-code binary; replaces the initial guess.

### v2.7.1 — Claude Pro Max as a provider
Browser-initiated OAuth, PKCE, encrypted-at-rest tokens.
